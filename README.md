# PlainSight Labs

**Governance, compliance, and ethical AI for finance and beyond**

## Our Mission

Trust through transparency. We build systems you can see and understand.

## What We Do

PlainSight Labs applies rigorous governance and ethical AI principles to solve real-world problems:

- **Financial Infrastructure** - Compliance and governance frameworks for DeFi and TradFi convergence
- **AI Governance** - Context-Forge and ethical AI systems for high-stakes applications  
- **Social Impact** - Leveraging technology for child safety and trafficking prevention

## Our Entities

- **PlainSight Labs** - Governance, compliance, and ethical AI authority
- **Invariant.org** - Protocol standards & specifications for financial systems
- **ClearLedger** - Transparent, non-custodial wallet

## Our Approach

We don't build AI systems that dream. We build systems with enforceable invariants, testable claims, and auditable governance.

Because real-world problems require correctness, not plausibility.

## Open Repositories

We believe in radical transparency. Our websites, governance frameworks, and protocols are public. Because trust requires proof, not promises.
