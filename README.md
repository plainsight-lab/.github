# PlainSight Labs

**Governance, correctness, and ethical AI for high-stakes systems**

## Our Mission

Trust through transparency.\
We build systems whose constraints, authority, and invariants are explicit and auditable.

## What We Do

PlainSight Labs establishes and stewards governance, invariants, and ethical AI constraints in adversarial, high-stakes systems:

- **Financial Infrastructure** \
  Pre-execution governance, protocol invariants, and compliance frameworks for adversarial financial systems
  
- **AI Governance** \
  Constraint-driven, human-authority AI systems designed for adversarial and safety-critical environments
    
- **Social Impact** \
  Reducing identification energy in social harm systems through auditable detection and invariant-based constraints

## Our Entities

- **PlainSight Labs** - Epistemic and governance authority; steward of invariants
- **Invariant Org** - Protocol standards and specifications for financial systems
- **ClearLedger** - Transparent, non-custodial wallet implementation

## Our Approach

We don't build AI systems that dream. \
We build systems with enforceable invariants, explicit authority boundaries, and auditable governance.

Because in adversarial, real-world systems, plausibility without correctness is a failure mode.

## Open Repositories

We believe in radical transparency. Our protocols, governance frameworks, and public systems are open by default — because legitimacy requires proof, not promises.
