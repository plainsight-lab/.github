# PlainSight Labs

**Governance, compliance, and ethical AI for finance and beyond**

## Our Mission

Trust through transparency.\
We build systems you can see and understand.

## What We Do

PlainSight Labs applies rigorous governance and ethical AI principles to high-stakes, real-world systems:

- **Financial Infrastructure** \
  Compliance, custody, and governance frameworks for DeFi and TradFi convergence
  
- **AI Governance** \
  Context-Forge and constraint-driven AI systems for regulated and safety-critical domains
    
- **Social Impact** \
  Applying the same auditable, invariant-based approach to child safety and trafficking prevention

## Our Entities

- **PlainSight Labs** - Governance, compliance, and ethical AI authority
- **Invariant.org** - Protocol standards and specifications for financial systems
- **ClearLedger** - Transparent, non-custodial wallet implementation

## Our Approach

We don't build AI systems that dream. \
We build systems with enforceable invariants, testable claims, and auditable governance.

Because real-world problems require correctness, not plausibility.

## Open Repositories

We believe in radical transparency. Our protocols, governance frameworks, and public systems are open by default—because trust requires proof, not promises.
